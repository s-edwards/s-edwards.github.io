<p>
My research and teaching activities all advance a common theme: improving
software quality through better design and better assessment.
In addition to researching design techniques that reduce the frequency of
defects, I am also interested in design techniques that promote software
testing, and even approaches to producing code with built-in self-testing
features. At the same time, I am passionate about bringing the most
effective of these techniques to our students, to train future practitioners
with the skills necessary to produce higher quality code.

<h2>Computer Science Education</h2>

<p>
  I regularly work on a variety of research projects in computer science
  education, including automated feedback strategies, assessment measures
  and metrics, gamification, innovative teaching methods, and techniques
  for nudging students to adopt more productive behaviors.

<h2>Web-CAT</h2>

<p>
  <a href="http://web-cat.org/">Web-CAT</a> is an advanced automated grading
  system that can grade students on how well they test their own code.
  Web-CAT is free and open source
  <a href="https://github.com/web-cat">on github</a>.
  It is
  highly customizable and extensible, and supports virtually any model of
  program grading, assessment, and feedback generation. Web-CAT is implemented
  as a web application with a plug-in-style architecture so that it also can
  serve as a platform for providing additional student support services to help
  students learn programming or software testing.
</p>
<p>
  As of September, 2020, the Web-CAT server at Virginia Tech had been used in
  1,642 course sections across 39 universities, on assignments covering 8
  programming languages, and has processed 4,368,856 submissions from
  49,758 students. This does not include submissions processed at other
  institutions running their own servers (approximately 90).

<h2>CodeWorkout</h2>

<a>
  <a href="https://codeworkout.cs.vt.edu">CodeWorkout</a>
  is an online system for people learning a programming language for the first
  time. It is a free, open-source solution for practicing small programming
  problems, also
  <a href="https://github.com/web-cat/code-workout">on github</a>.
  Students may practice coding exercises on a variety of programming
  concepts within the convenience of a web browser. Exercises provide
  customized, immediate feedback to support learning and suggests appropriate
  exercises as students improve their mastery.
</p>
<p>
  CodeWorkout was inspired by many great systems built by others, but aims to
  bring together the best from earlier forerunners while adding important new
  features. It provides comprehensive support for teachers who want to use
  coding exercises in their courses, while also maintaining flexibility for
  self-paced learners who aren't part of an organized course.

<h2>PEML</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://cssplice.github.io/peml/">PEML</a>, the Programming Exercise
  Markup Language, is a simple, easy format for CS and IT instructors of all
  kinds (college, community college, high school, whatever) to describe
  programming assignments and activities. We want it to be so easy (and
  obvious) to use that instructors won't see it as a technological or
  notational barrier to expressing their assignments.
  PEML is being developed as part of the SPLICE project to make it easier
  for new users to begin using automated assessment tools.
</p>

<h2>SPLICE</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="https://cssplice.github.io/">SPLICE</a> project (Standards,
  Protocols, and Learning Infrastructure for Computing Education) is a
  multi-university project with a mission to support the CS Education
  community by supplying documentation and infrastructure to help with adopting
  shared standards, protocols, and tools. In this way we hope to promote
  development and broader re-use of innovative learning content that is
  instrumented for rich data collection;
  formats and tools for analysis of learner data; and
  best practices to make large collections of learner data and associated
  analytics available to researchers in the CSE, data science, and learner
  science communities.
