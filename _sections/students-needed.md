I am interested in hearing from everyone who is excited about independent
study or research projects, from the undergraduate looking for undergraduate
research credit to the Ph.D. candidate looking for a topic. However, I
expect to work with serious, self-directed, research-oriented students who are
capable of both carrying out and clearly writing up research projects with
little supervision. I am willing to discuss potential topics in
<a href="#projects" class="scrolly">any of the projects described above</a>.
Here are a few more specific topics where I am looking to add students:

* __PEMLtest__: Developing and implementing a streamlined domain-specific
  language for writing software test cases.
* __CodeWorkout Algorithm Visualization__: Adapting an existing program
  animation tool (the Python Tutor and its relatives) for use in CodeWorkout to
  allow students to debug/step through their own solutions to small programming
  exercises using data that causes them to fail.
* __Gamification of Programming Assignments__: Adding a unique combination of
  multiple game-inspired mechanisms and features to how students work,
  so that students
  can earn achievements, see their skills develop, and learn how to
  practice productive student behaviors.
* __Dockerized Web-CAT__: Develop a container deployment strategy for
  Web-CAT servers, including dockerhub images for Web-CAT and a
  Kubernetes strategy for cluster deployment.
* __Java Program Analysis Microservices__: Develop containerized Java
  services to perform various analysis tasks (static analysis, compilation,
  etc.) in order to provide higher performance assessment platforms.
* __Worked Examples__: Providing automated support for allowing students to
  use reference examples of solutions, and build similarly structured answers
  to similar problems so they can learn the patterns.
* __Multi-part Coding Questions__: Adding support for exercises with multiple
  parts to CodeWorkout.
* __Automatic Test Data Generation__: Adapting techniques used in some
  functional programming languages for generating test data used to test
  student programs in various contexts.
* __Programming Question Generators__: Adapting techniques used to parameterize
  exercises to work in CodeWorkout to provide custom, individualized versions
  of exercises to each student.
